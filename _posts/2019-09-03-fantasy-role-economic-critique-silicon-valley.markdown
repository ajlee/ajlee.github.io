In my MA in Political Economy, I wrote my dissertaion on ideology at Facebook, and how this relates to the Cambridge Analytica crisis. This post is about why ideology critique is necessary, how this relates to understanding dreams, and briefly I look at what this means at Facebook. 

This blog post is based on research in my MA in Political Economy, in which I analysed the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Facebook's culture using Zizek's ideology critique. [Read the whole dissertation](/politics/2018/12/05/californian-ideology-cambridge-analytica.html).

## The Californian Ideology

The Californian Ideology is a [well known paper by Barbrook and Cameron](http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/the-californian-ideology-2/), which traces the historical roots of Silicon Valley culture from the pro-democracy and anti-military campaigns in the 60s and 70s, such as campaigns against the Vietnam War and for civil rights. This ideology rejected ideas from older generations, expressed new ideals of equality and freedom, and sought to create empowering new political structures. As this culture grew in influence, belief in cybernetic theories spread, such Marshall McLuhan’s ideas that posited that new communications would enable everyone to be free from authoritarian control, allowing individuals and direct democracy to overthrow government and big business. This ideology is somewhat paradoxical, merging hippy counter-culture with free-market libertarianism. The contradictions in these beliefs are held together through resistance against government control and believing in the emancipatory potential of technology. Barbrook and Cameron understand people holding this ideology as wilfully ignoring questions of human rights, poverty, and environmental degradation. Instead, they understand these people as selfishly immersing themselves in fantasies of utopian technologies, while also covering up the negative consequences of their actions to enjoy their high wages, interesting work, and powerful status.

## False Consciousness

The notion that the rich and powerful are deliberately covering up the consequences of their actions has historical roots in early Marxist thought. Engels argued the bourgeoisie were covering over the reality of exploitation, a concept developed by Gramsci, Lukács, and others, an understanding that equates ideology with "false consciousness". This belief suggests the reality of the world must be exposed in order for workers to understand their real conditions of existence, overthrow capitalism and install a socialist society. Ideology, for many Marxists, is defined as a delusion from which we need to be freed. However, Marx’s theory of ideology was not always compatible with the "false consciousness" theory; for example, his analysis of [commodity fetishism](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/marxism/modules/marxfetishism.html) focused on how the appearance of commodities disguised reality, which is a different understanding from “false consciousness”. However, it remained a common epistemological perspective in Marxism of objective external reality which can be unmasked.

The notion that the ideological mask covers objective reality suggests that the reproduction of the dominant system depends on it staying hidden. When it is exposed as false, it can no longer reproduce itself. Workers only accept capitalism because they do not understand their own exploitation. I believe this is partly true, but as Eagleton's book Ideology covers, this misses the complex ways that people make sense of their world. At the start of the book he introduces the many varied ways of using the term ideology, and then moves onto the Marxist notion of ideology as being crucial to legitimise capitalism. But he criticises the Marxist notion that sees support for capitalism as simply a delusion, arguing that dominant capitalist ideologies must somehow ring true with people's experiences and with their dreams. 
In order to be successfully circulating through our culture, ideology must make sense of people’s experience. In the 90s, there was a proliferation of organisations doing away with heirarchical structures, because the criticism of capitalism at the time was that large organisations were disimpowering, inefficient, and bearaucratic; the modern, digital networked organisation was supposed to solve this. This change connected with people's existing beliefs about their work as too being too heirarchical, and the networked organisation was capitalism's solution. Now the networked organisation is common, workers are no better off. People are just exploited in new ways, such as self-monitoring, greater intensity of work, and zero-hours contracts.

The theory of "false consciousness" influences a great deal of Marxist work, which aims to expose the real conditions of the working class and the contradictions of the capitalist economy. Barbrook and Cameron aimed to unmask the Californian Ideology by demonstrating how Silicon Valley relies on racism, exploitation, and surveillance. But the entrepeneurs of Silicon Valley [did not accept this account of reality](http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/to-mutoids-re-californian-ideology ). Even today, when workers are confronted with horrendous living conditions, terrible inequality, institutional mysogyny, and dull thankless work, people still believe the utopian ideals of Silicon Valley can be achieved through entrepeneurship and hard work. This is visible, for example, in Antionio Martinez's book Chaos Monkeys, or in [Corey Pein's account of trying to get rich](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/17/get-rich-quick-silicon-valley-startup-billionaire-techie). In these accounts, workers understand their conditions of existence, but it takes a long time to overcome their fantasy of digital capitalist utopia, if that ever happens at all. So, understanding our conditions of existence and exploitation is not enough to fight against capitalism: [Wendy Liu](https://notesfrombelow.org/article/organising-silicon-valleys-shadow-workforce), is one of a number of ex-Silicon Valley workers who have turned to socialism after their experiences of working there. Disillusionment in an opportunity to confront the injustices of capitalism, but this confrontation does not automatically occur. The opposite is true, we _avoid_ making this confrontation as it challenges our entire world view. To make this confrontation, we need to be ready to let go of our dreams... a frightening experience, more so if we have invested a great deal of time and energy into trying to achieve these dreams.

## The Utopian Cybernetic Fantasy

This failure to understand the role of the fantasy prevents critics of Silicon Valley from effectively challenging the capitalist economy. Rather than take on board Barbrook and Cameron's observations, [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/2014/01/california-ideology-andy-cameron-richard-barbrook/) calls their ideas "entertainingly bonkers", or less politely [Louis Rossetto calls their work](https://web.archive.org/web/19970614205217/http://www.wmin.ac.uk/media/HRC/ci/calif2.html) an "anal retentive attachment to failed 19th century social and economic analysis". Capitalists being presented with facts about their exploitative businesses practice doesn't often result in them giving up their ways and becoming communists. Rather, we expect capitalists to double-down on their beliefs. When presented with terrible ways that Amazon treats workers, such as lines of ambulances that to park outside ready to support workers when they get sick, Bezos demands that we should be grateful that Amazon gives us jobs at all. When Elon Musk is told how is company is forcing workers to sleep in their cars, he attackes them and says they should be grateful to be working on such an important project. Bill Gates makes huge profits from "philanthro-capitalism", that is, philanthropic work that results in personal profit (which seems to somewhat stretch the concept of philanthropy). He dismisses criticism as... [REF]. Standard Marxist critique would dismiss them as capitalist that are simply lying and trying to enrich themselves. But all these capitalists _do_ appear passionate about their business, not merely as a profit making company. Gates _does_ appear to be passionate about malaria and poverty; _Musk_ does appear to care about climate change; Bezos, meanwhile, seems passionate about a libertarian utopia. They are not merely capitalists, they are _capitalists with a fantasy_, where capitalist free markets are used to achieve a better world. These fantasies we can understand through psychoanalytic analysis, which Zizek uses to understand social ideologies.


Owners of social media companies are so caught up in the dream of a utopian capitalist society that they are impervious to criticism. Based on Lacan and Žižek's work, we can understand that dreams are necessary to understand the world around us. As social beings, people necessarily use fantasy to create understanding, which creates a complete picture of “reality” based on partial knowledge of the world.  Fantasies are both personal and shared, where social narratives combine with contingent scenarios in an individual’s life. For example, in advertising, we are told fantasies of new, smarter technologies that will improve our lives, and movies may tell us the USA saves us from terrorism, communists, aliens, and so on. The social components circulate through culture and combine with personal fantasies to function as a screen, together enabling us to understand the world. Rather than fantasy covering over reality, dominant social fantasies help subjects construct “reality” in a way which supports the reproduction of the dominant social order. Rather than seeing these fantasies as a problem though, fantasy can be understood as fundamental to our human existence. We can never fully understand the world around us, and fantasies function in every day life to create a complete and coherent picture. Without a Marxist understanding of capitalism, the capitalists can believe in a fantasy of a capitalist utopia, where technological change has solved climate change, poverty, and freed us from tiresome work. Bezos can believe in his fantasy of libertarianism without governments, where everyone is free. Of course, such beliefs are impossible, which is the analysis that Marx has provided us with. But without a critical view of capitalism, the owners of these rich multinationals _can_ believe that capitalism can achieve these things. Rather than understanding the capitalist class as simply trying to exploit and enrich, we can understand them as trying to reach an impossible dream - in fact, by striving for it, capitalism takes their dream further away.

As I cover in my dissertaion, Facebook's ideology is incredibly powerful. From the moment that workers enter the organisation, they are required to believe that Facebook is the final stage of human evolution, a dream that seems ridiculous to outsiders, but for employees, is totally serious and very powerful, which Antonio Martinez's book covers in great detail. Rather than understanding Zuckerberg as cynically exploiting users, we can see him as desperately trying to achieve an impossible dream of Internet community and equality.
