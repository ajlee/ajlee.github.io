The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed some huge problems with our economic system. One of these is with housing. Huge numbers of people in lower income brackets are spending a vast amount of their income on rent. With many people losing their jobs, working reduced hours, or simply having huge uncertainties around future income, will not be able to afford their rent. Labour's current policy of suspending rent payments for two years is farcical and shows an ignorance of the huge scale of the economic crisis facing us. The income of many people is not going to return to normal anytime soon and so even after two years people its bizarre to think people can pay back their rent. Secondly, with many renters taking an income hit during the crisis, why shouldn't landlords share the financial hit? Why place the burden entirely on renters?

Obviously, some landlords pay mortgages and they need support too. But there are ways to support both homeowners and renters, as [NEF's policy paper outlines](https://neweconomics.org/2020/05/suspending-rents). This would mean both rent and mortgage cancellations for the duration of the crisis. Thaganam Debonaire, the Labour shadow housing minister, recently argued that mass cancellation was "un-Labour" because some rich people that would have rent cancellations would benefit. This is a bizarre argument... presumably she would think the NHS is "un-Labour" because some rich people use it. The principle of universalism is a core part of socialism.

On the 15th May, Eastbourne CLP sent a letter to the Labour leadership on this issue. The decision to send this was made unofficially by the executive since motions cannot be passed during the pandemic. The letter is below - please share and send to your local CLPs.

To Kier Starmer and Angela Rayner,


Re: Protecting Renters


We are writing in regard to the recent announcement to support renters during the COVID-19 pandemic as many local party members from Eastbourne CLP have expressed concern. In particular this is in regard to changes from rent suspension to rent deferral. This policy change will have a huge impact on tenants, including indebtedness and eviction.

It is worth noting that 35% of renters already living in poverty (1). Since lockdown started, nearly all workers have faced changes in work. While the furlough and freelancer support scheme has helped many people, we are facing a long economic crisis - 5.6 million people are at high risk of losing their jobs, with 1.2 million living in rented accommodation (2). Many will lose their jobs and will struggle to find another at the current time. Even with the furlough and freelance support scheme (3) when workers return to work they are likely to face reduced hours and freelancers face a having a significantly reduced income. While the lowest paid will be saddled with rent debt, in contrast, businesses are getting business support such as rate relief, grants and loans.

Labour should be speaking up on behalf of the many private renters in every constituency across the UK. Renters are overwhelmingly working class people that Labour should be speaking up for. Those with mortgages also need our support. The mortgage holidays announced by the government merely saddle homeowners with more debt too (4).

It is positive that Labour is calling for an end to Section 21 no fault evictions, give tenants more protection, stronger regulation, more social housing, and make major improvements to Universal Credit (4). However, we at Eastbourne CLP believe Labour’s position on rent deferral will mean that renters will still face a huge and unfair burden. One alternative that Labour could consider is outlined by the New Economics Foundation (5). This includes:

• No obligation for private tenants during the crisis to pay any rent, and changing the law to mean non-payment of rent does not constitute a breach of contract

• The rent suspension should apply to all, even those in the informal economy who rent without an official contract

• The government to implement a mortgage freeze for the duration of the crisis to protect homeowners

• The Bank of England should offer low-cost loans to banks and other mortgage owners to help with cash flows

This is merely one alternative. We ask you to consider this and any alternative way to end rent and mortgage payments during the crisis and prevent the poorest bearing the brunt of the crisis.

Thank you.

The Executive Committee of Eastbourne Constituency Labour Party.

Please note this letter is sent following an online informal process that has been carried out as democratically as possible. Post lockdown the letter will be subjected to a physical EC/CLP meeting and be either formally ratified or not.

* Small and micro businesses not paying business rate can only defer their rent and will also be building up debt just as private renters are.
