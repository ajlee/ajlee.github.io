## FC Holidays
I currently work two days a week for (FC Holidays)[https://fcholidays.com] on their Drupal site. I took over from agencies and work a couple of days a week making changes and updates, primarily working on front end SASS and Twig code, with some work on custom modules such as Campaign Monitor integration.

## Friends of the Earth
In 2017, (Friends of the Earth)[http://friendsearth.uk] moved from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8. I worked primarily on front end SASS and Twig code for layout using Bootstrap for six months.

## DR Agency
This digital agency had me working on a website for a large educational Drupal organisation's website for several months. Unfortunately, the non-disclosure contract means I can't tell you which one!

## Friends of the Earth Europe
In 2014, I worked for this charity on several projects: making their Drupal website responsive, enabling them to create digital newsletters, and more.
