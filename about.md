Alex Eel lives on a street in Levenshulme, in a nice community next to a park.

I work as a freelance developer, mostly Drupal; and I am also interested in left-wing politics and economics, having just completed an MA in International Political Economy, where I analysed ideologies of Silicon Valley.
 
I have been involved in volunteering and campaigning since 2007 with Friends of the Earth Manchester, but this developed into more of an interest in politics, eventually leading me to take an MA. I am interested in critical theory, ideology critique, socialist economics, environmental politics and technology.

I maintain a local park website at [Highfield Country Park](highfieldcountrypark.org.uk), which really should be moved onto Jekyll, since the current site was supposed to just be a prototype for testing but now has been going for over a year... (plug: this site is built in Jekyll... great for small sites. Obviously Drupal is still great but is going more and more towards complex enterprise systems.)

I write songs too. Some classics are "Flip, I forgot my flipping lunch", "Too tough to love", and "The Internet of Aaaargh!". A few songs are at [my soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/alexisapparatus) and [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/alexanansi). Hopefully I will upload more soon!
