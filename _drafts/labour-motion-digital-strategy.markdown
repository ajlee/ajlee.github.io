Motion to Labour

In Section 3, the current goals and measures are inadequate. Additional targets to measure the impact of digital technology on society need to be implemented with input from experts from a broad range of people, such as social scientists, psychologists, campaigners and labour unions. Critics of digital technologies should be part of this group too.

This branch believes that measurements should include commitments to: 
- to ensure those that are made redundant from automation are given various options to retrain and are not demoted to unskilled jobs
- support alternative measures of ownership
- avoid monopoly ownership
- ensure that public services always ensure people have full control knowledge and control over which third parties have access to use their data. This should be opt-in rather than opt-out, so that by default people's data is never given to a third party without their agreement.
.
Not just aspirational "progress must be universal" - measure it and make sure it happens. 

The answer to making people have "happy, healthy productive lives" requires input from a broad range of expertise, rather than only involving entrepeneurs and influencial figures in Greater Manchester. 

Ensure that public services retain an option to avoid using digital services, so those that are are unable or refuse to use digital technologies still have access to use our public services and are not disadvantaged.

Recognise that the digital economy is a choice, not a must. The choice to make Manchester a leading digital city must not be at any cost. As such, we need to be able to measure the benefits of the digital economy against the cost bourne by citizens. For example, the document recognises that the digital economy may hit automation may hit workers hard. If the price bourne by the working class is high, then this digital strategy is the wrong strategy for Greater Manchester.

Recognise their are alternatives, and the Labour party's altnative outline of a redistributive digital economy is one of these. 

An app cannot solve all our social problems. Digital economy needs to be implemented in the context of an overall redistrebutive economy, it will not happen on its own.

Unions etc should have ongoing input into this strategy

Other industries (e.g. music, hotels) should be able to input into this strategy as these industries may be disrupted

Support and encourage businesses that are open and transparent about their algorithms and use of data, and require them to take into account the opinions of Manchester citizens. Not like the walled-off, out of control companies like Facebook.

No military products to be developed in Greater Manchester

Anyone using open data from public services should use open source technologies

Education on tech should be a right - not just to get a job, or because services are digital. No one should be forced to learn tech, and people who don't want to use tech should not be discriminated against. People of any age should have opportunities to learn digital skills but no simply as a pathway to getting a job, but because they are interested in the subject for its own sake.
