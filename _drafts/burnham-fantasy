### A fantasy of a harmonious digital revolution

In December 2018, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority released their Greater Manchester Digital Strategy. In it, Manchester is transformed... it is no longer a place with any downsides. Inequality, pollution, homelessness, and democracy have all been solved thanks to global verture capitalists seeing to make fortunes. They will help to create interesting creative jobs for everyone, and will create apps that solve all our social problems. It will be an innovative utopia of wonderful creativity, a place of global sigificance but unique local character, and a place that does not tolerate social deprivation. It will be Silicon Valley in the North of England, but without any of the downsides that exist in California. Amazing, and of course, it is something that _all_ people in Greater Manchester people will want.

It is an amazing vision that is clear. But there is nothing unique in having such grandiose and fantastical economic delusions. The wonderful smart city of the future is a dream many other cities are chasing. None of these visions recognise the dark side of Silicon Valley that is inseparable from the beautiful and innovative facade. And instead of being based on local character, the global smart city is the forces of capitalism seeking to make every city the same. Instead,  Manchester has a much radical tradtions that we can use to make a better digital economy that works better for the vast majority (but possibly not for the rich).

### doing things "differently" - just like everywhere else

"I want Greater Manchester to be a digital city with a difference", [Andy Burnham](https://www.thinkdigitalpartners.com/news/2017/05/23/burnham-sets-ambitious-plan-future-smart-city-manchester/). 

The strategy has a major emphasis on being different, innovative, open, connected, thinking outside the box. It tells us that we can be a world leader but also Mancunian. It tells us that we can have a digital ecomony with well-known digital companies based here alongside small startups, innovation labs, and local businesses, working together. What makes Greater Manchester different, it says, is an aspiration be "bottom up", to make progress "universal", where problems like inequality and homelessness are not tolerated - these social issues will be resolve by businesses who develop apps, cruch data, and develop new products to solve everything.

It is evident from these claims that the writers are completely unfamiliar with almost every other government digital strategy across the world. If they had done such research, they would be surely be surprised to discover these words and claims of being "different" and "unique" are used by almost every other city region's digital strategy. Perhaps they are all copying Manchesters amazing and unique traditions??? But it seems not... shockingly, we are not the first... we seem to be copying everyone else! [Sadiq Kahn wants London to be the smartest city]((, [New York claims to be the smartest city](https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/909-16/new-york-named-2016-best-smart-city-nyc-host-2017-international-conference-urban), so does San Jose http://www.sanjoseca.gov/index.aspx?NID=5730, and Melbourne (https://connection.vic.gov.au/?result_17022_result_page=11). Melbourne (https://dif.vic.gov.au/editorial/642-a/using-technology-for-real-social-impact), Austin claims to be a smart city that is both "bottom up" and "top down" (https://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=287471) that improves the lives of "all Austinites", while all Londoners will benefit from their strategy (https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/social_integration_strategy.pdf). Birmingham, Swansea, Gateshead, Leicester... It's not just cities, but [manufacturing](https://www.i-scoop.eu/manufacturing-industry/), [libraries](https://www.leicestershire.gov.uk/leisure-and-community/libraries/smart-libraries), [universities](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/22/are-university-campuses-turning-into-mini-smart-cities), [transport](https://www.zdnet.com/article/smart-cities-why-oslo-wants-its-buses-to-do-far-more-than-just-transport-people/), [hospitals](https://readwrite.com/2019/03/01/smart-hospitals-the-next-step-in-healthcare-it/), [farms](https://medium.com/zerone-magazine/smart-agriculture-for-smart-city-726f53f78b47). There is rarely any serious investigation about whether these things will improve society, it is presumed. They all use the new digital lexicon of trendy Californian start-ups that which covers over this absence of empirical evidence and thought: calling things "open", "connective", "networked", "bottom-up", and "democratic" creates a fantasy that of course society improves with technology.  Of course, there doesn't actually need to be anything of substance behind these claims, because that's how marketing in capitalism works. Coca-cola promises "that this is the real thing". Every product tells you "this is the best", "we are different", and so on. That these claims are empty is beyond obvious, banal; the point is to pretend you are differnent. Thus we can understand the Greater Manchester Smart City as merely marketing itself as global brand, anywhere city, a place to make shit loads of cash for some faceless venture capitalists demanding massive returns at all costs.

Its nice that Greater Manchester wants to be different. We can have shiny buildings with creative hubs everywhere.... we will stand out from San Francisco's smart city,  London's smart city, Melbourne's smart city, New York's smart city, because we have Stone Roses t-shirts and Northern accents. 

As a famous man called Brian might say: 
>You are all different!

And all the world's smart cities will say: 
>Yes, our city-wide ecosystem of creative hubs, innovation labs and start-ups make us totally unique!


### There is No Alternative
 It is clear from the last section that Manchester's claims to be unique appears to be are just marketing buzzwords... everywhere wants to be a smart city attracting global investment. In market terms, all these cities are competing to be the winner, to attract the global investors. But why do we have to do this? Well, the GM Digital strategy challenges this in a vigourous argument, which I can summarise in four words, which are "we _can_" and "we _must_" (their italics). So that's settled. Off you go reader, go and be productive and innovative, don't ask why! You can! You must! 
 
 Of course, everyone knows the famous quote from Thatcher. "There is no alternative", she said. Well, yes in a way, within the internal logic of neoliberal capitalism, it is true, there is no alternative. You must be more competitive, productive, and efficient. In modern day Silicon Valley ideology this drive for competitive advantage is communicated through words like innovative, connective, open, and so on. Businesses, countries, and cities have no choice but to do these things, otherwise we will be the economic losers (the existence of 'losers' as well as economic 'winners' is the terrible aspect of capitalism that we do not acknowledge, but which we still fear). (Enjoying Neoliberalism)
 
In the GM Digital Strategy, "winning" is about being the "smartest city" and attracting the most outside investment, and it is clear that many other cities want to be the world leaders too. So in the logic of competition, all these city regions must compete to attract this global investment. Existing businesses "cannot afford to overlook such fundamental shifts in the marker". Accept the new digital world, businesses are told, or that will be the end of your business. There is no arguing with this, no fighting it, you embrace or die, there is no other way. 

"the best environment to nurture, welcome and grow digital businesses". In Todd McGowan's book, the Psychic Cost of Free Markets, he devotes one chapter to the role of sacrifice in capitalism. Capitalism considers itself beyond religion and God. And yet, everyday, while we work, we sacrifice ourselves for productivity and efficiency.  Our bodies may be damaged, our mental health may erode, we lose free time we could be spending on our hobbies and with our loved ones... the sacrifice in capitalism is the working class, whose lives must be given up willingly. We are promised if we word hard and sacrifice ourselves eventually we are promised to get our reward. We also may sacfice other things: nature, public services, ... etc. 
 
What does this mean for Manchester? Do we have sacrifice everything to make our city as business friendly as possible in order to get to this digital utopia that is within reach? One or two clues are in the document. For example, it says that we must ensure "that our digital ecosystem is as frictionless as possible." This frictionless future is a fantasy of a neoliberal zero-gravity utopia where capitalism pushes itself towards light speeds (Featherstone, 2010, IGC9)... which aims to resolve resolve all the failings of the present through more and more technology (Will Self, IGC9). However, these contradictions do not get resolved with more technology; these contradictions _are_ capitalism. The global competition for investment, to be "the smartest city" in practice, becomes are route to becoming the "most privatised city". Public resources such as land, data, money, expertise, and so on are directed into attracting these global businesses. They function as a bribe, but the utopian vision of the smart city believes these will create jobs, equality and security... which will happen at some point in the future... a beautiful future that will never happen. (Grossi, Pianezzi, Smart city utopia paper).

Lets look at data. The first thing to notice is that this data is data about Manchester's workers, residents, children, this data has to be made easily available. Your permission could be considered to be one of the pieces of red tape, friction, which interupts the accumulation of profit, and therefore, must be made smoother. This appears to be happening already: [millions have their footfall tracked already in Manchester City Centre](https://twitter.com/MikAlexH/status/1071392667442036736) and [councillors are silent on adverts using facial recognition](https://twitter.com/LozKaye/status/966967172420468737) without permission. Another clue is in the already [impressive open data services in Manchester](http://open.manchester.gov.uk/homepage/3/open_data_catalogue), which allow granular access of data on everything from car parks, to metrolinks, to street lighting. Of course, there is a positive element to this: open data can be used by local people to hold the authorities to account. But open data is not happening in Manchester because there is a massive push from the public for it. It is happening because of business demand for our data, and to attract global business. Businesses using our public data may provide useful services, as long as we pay for it. The _public_ data that enabled these services thus becomes _private_ data that is inaccessible to us. As a recent government paper says, the benefits of open data to the [economy are massive](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/731349/20180730_HMT_Discussion_Paper_-_The_Economic_Value_of_Data.pdf), but it is only the public institutions that have to provide open data, the private sector takes it, monetises it, and then keeps it to themselves. The [NHS](http://openhealthcare.org.uk/open-data-in-the-health-sector/) is increasingly providing open data, the national government already provides a huge number, and promises by big companies to protect our data are worthless. This is the logic of neoliberalism. In times of austerity,  desperate and penniless public sector organisations have to give private companies your personal data in order to deliver the service. This is not the smart city, this is the privatised city. And as political economist Harvey notes, super-mobile VC funding is able to move anywhere very easily, so the bribes and freebies to the private sector must be continuous. As soon as the climate becomes difficult, the money is pulled out, moved to somewhere more business friendly.
 
 We have no alternative, we have to hand over all our public data. If we don't... As Manchester digital activist says, politicians have a great optimism about the digital strategy. But optimism is not necessarily good: this optimism is a fantasy, the reality is more likely to be a privatised digital dystopia.  

### social disaster will be solved with an app


https://openintelligence.uk/news/technology/greater-manchester-digital-tech-summit/

One very noticable point in the document relates to automation and AI. Interestingly, for a neoliberal document, the GM Digital Strategy this shows this ideology trying to grabble with capitalism's economic losers. In previous economic crises, like the 2008 economic crash, the losers are brushed under the carpet by our government, ignored while we talk of making the country better for business. But automation is a potential criseris that is so big, even neoliberal economists struggle to ignore it [REF](). The document states that the digital change will be:
> hugely disruptive both for the UK but also for the GM economy, having a profound and potentially unprecedented impact on production techniques, supply chains, business models, workforce and global networks.

A [study by PriceWaterhouseCoopers](https://www.pwc.co.uk/services/economics-policy/insights/the-impact-of-automation-on-jobs.html) suggests 30% of jobs could be lost to automation, particularly [low-waged jobs](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/08/the-potential-to-automate-low-wage-jobs-in-the-u-s-and-its-impact-on-workers) and jobs [women bearing the brunt](https://www.thersa.org/about-us/media/2018/women-bearing-the-brunt-of-job-losses-as-age-of-automation-takes-hold-warns-rsa). One of the surprising things about reading Capital Vol I was how this is so similar to the situation with automation of the weavers jobs. Weavers collectively resisted automation, destroying machines that threatened their jobs; before turning their attacks on the capitalists who were laying them off rather than the machines. They did not succeed, after after being made redundant, were hired back but on vastly lower wages. By creating mass unemployment, capitalism keeps wages low because we are so desperate to work. Automation and AI is the 21st Century's nightmare for the working class, and even capitalists such as Elon Musk are considering radical ideas such as UBI. 

The GM Digital Strategy grapples with this looming destruction of working class jobs and women by suggesting we go to coding classes, evening courses, and so on. That way the class and gendered impact of job losses can be individualised - "You lost your job to a machine? Well, its your own fault, you should have taught yourself to code!" Many liberal economists are already making precisely this arguement. There are some economists that suggest new high-paying jobs will be created. However, there is no actual evidence to support this. It didn't happen in the industrial revolution, when the weavers were automated. The logic of capitalism is actually pushing highly-paid workers wages down - if everyone can code, the wages of programmers will no longer be high, because companies can easily find workers who need a job.

However, not to worry, if you lose your job, and end up homeless, unemployed or depressed; even if you turn to drugs, the GM Digital Strategy will help. It shows us a future where all our problems can be solved with an app. Yes, Seattle did a great job with their app to solve homelessness, which [served to push out homeless people](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/an-app-for-ejecting-the-homeless/563849/), which based on Manchester desire to implement a Public Space Protection Order to get rid of homelessness, is an app they would be totally on board with. Perhaps we could get Facebook to help young people find job opportunities [after spying on their online activies and illegally harvesting their data](http://www.cityam.com/272471/facebook-removes-controversial-app-pays-teenagers-their). As Evgeny Morozov covers in _Click Here to Fix Everything_, an app can solve anything. An app that automatically takes pictures of your bins will motivate everyone to recycle; apps can fix our democracy by allowing online debate, self-organisation and voting (Facebook's doing a great job isn't it); an app can help you learn to cook through monitoring your kitchen and telling you off when you deviate from a recipe. So given San Francisco's overwhelming success at creating an equal employment opportunities, fair housing, (transport (google buses), these fantastic Man 




### California: case study
Greater Manchester wants to emulate the cool trendy innovation of California, with tech startups creating the tools that put Manchester on the international stage. But this report does not examine the other side of Silicon Valley. The Silicon Valley economy is inseperable from its dark side. Increasingly, stories show Silicon Valley creates a faceless, unequal, and ??? society. [Inequality is getting worse](https://www.recode.net/2018/10/13/17953004/wages-workers-silicon-valley-income-inequality) with the rich getting incredibly wealthy, while the poor are worse off. Residents struggle to afford basics such as [housing](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2019/02/15/report-inequality-on-the-rise-in-silicon-valley) in a market where Airbnb and other apps have completely changed the economy, while childcare and transportation are increasingly unaffordable. While most cannot afford transport, workers in tech companies have their own private buses, and anger at their impact on the economy is demonstrated by ([Google's private bus service being attacked](https://mashable.com/2018/01/17/google-bus-attacked/?europe=true). Meanwhile, persoal accounts of the startup industry do not show a world of innovation. [Wendy Liu](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/digitaliberties/silicon-inquiry/) describes her startup as a "desperate yearning for our startup to mean something", and worked herself into the ground for an illusion. In reality the only startups that get funding are those who make massive returns for private investors. [Antonio Garcia Marquez in Chaos Monkeys](REF) tells a similar story, and after several years in a startup and Facebook concludes that Silicon Valley is an "amoral farce" running on incompetence, greed and vanity, hidden behind a fantasy of meritocracy, a place where massive profits forgives all your sins. In (Move Fast and Break Things)[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/napster-spotify-and-the-fall-of-the-middle-class-musician-116858/], Jonathan Taplin describes how "innovative" sites like Napster and YouTube made many musicians almost peniless. Other horrific stories about Silicon Valley experiences are increasingly widespread. 

The Greater Manchester Digital Strategy wants to have the Silicon Valley model of capitalism. They only talk about the shiny facade that presents itself to the world - but this is inseperable from the inequality, exploitation and monopolisation of power that has occurred in California.  
### manchester's history shows a real alternative 
Andy Burnham cites Manchester's history of creating innovative solutions to old problems. But what this investigation has shown is that he is using solutions that have already been tried and have failed. The global competition to attract investment means creating the most business-friendly city (i.e. deregulation, privitisation, and diverting tax-payers money into corporations); social chaos caused by startups trying to fix our social and economic problems; inequality driven by the concentration of wealth; and the potentially terrible consequences of automation and AI on jobs. This model is not new. In fact, this model is one of the reasons there are crises over companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, that dominate our digital lives, and it needs to end. 
 
Instead we need to look at Greater Manchester's geniune radical history for inspiration. Trade unions, socialism, Chartists* and cooperative movements are some of these ideas. and  In 1844 the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers formed, in response to the Industrial Revolution, which was forcing more and more people into poverty to mechinisation of their trades. Nowadays, Manchester is home to the UK largest cooperative - the Cooperative Group. It is somewhat unrecognisable from the traditional cooperatives, with a convoluted and confusing democratic system, unaccountable senior members on massive salaries, resulting little worker control over their activies. [Mondragon is perhaps a better example](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/24/alternative-capitalism-mondragon): where workers get to choose which directors to hire and fire, where there is a cap on wage differences, and enables workers to decide what and how they produce. 

In the digital sector, cooperative alternatives do exist too. In Catalonia, the Cooperativa Integral Catalana (CIC) is testing the possiblities of worker owned technologies. Its stated purpose is to create an alternative economy that satisfies the needs of the people in the region. https://p2pfoundation.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/The-Catalan-Integral-Cooperative.pdf. Cooperatives form a key part of the municipal governments economic strategy. Data is not just used as a means to make profit, it is ["treated like it is someone's stuff"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038026118758533). Research is published under licences that mean everyone can access information and technologies, encouraging a geniune peer-to-peer economy. Rather than profits being taken outside of the region, to a few rich billionaires, profits are aimed to be redistributed equally. 

Andy Burnham says* that we have no choice but to embrace this model, but of course this is an illusion. We only have no choice if we accept neoliberalism as the only means of managing the economy. But Manchester's history shows an alternative exists; Barcelona is showing how this can work in the digital economy; and of course, he is in a Labour Party, which published a manifesto on alternative forms of ownership, which embraced cooperative ideas and redistributive economics. Allegedly, Andy Burham is a member of the Labour Party - as well as the Co-operative Party, which is linked to Labour - so it is somewhat of a mystery that he is not aware of an alternative! Perhaps he hasn't been paying attention. Of course, getting the all the regions of Greater Manchester to support a cooperative economy would be challenging. Andy Burnham suggests that he want ["Manchester to be the most cooperative place in the UK"](https://party.coop/2018/07/30/andy-burnham-announces-co-operative-commission-to-ensure-manchester-the-most-co-operative-region-of-uk/), but this is totally at odds with the GM digital strategy of attracting massive outside investment from venture capitalists. His statements about having a "small number of evidence sessions" and asking for evidence from experts are signs of someone who wants to hear the case from cooperatives, not someone who really believes in them, or thinks they can become a major part of the local economy. Once workers and society owns and controls the digital economy, we can actually direct investment into building tools that benefit society. However, Andy Burnham's recent attacks on workers organisations suggest that his opinions on workers control may be entirely geniune.

 It is fortunate that others in the party are pushing these ideas. Dan Carden in his manifesto for Sheffield, explicitly [supported cooperative organisations in a local manifesto](https://party.coop/2018/04/20/dan-jarvis-publishes-plans-for-a-co-operative-community-in-south-yorkshire/) to create local economy that is more democratic and equal.


### Discarded

The foreward by the GM mayor and Trafford Council leader Sean Anstree promises a fantastical future for the region. This will make Manchester "one of the best places in the world", where "all voices are heard", a place in which "together, we shape our future". This will create a "world-leading" economy that "draws in investment" from all corners of the world, but also is an economy that built "together" in a "universal" way, where everyone beneifts from a "bottom up" approach. It will be "game-changing", delivering "real change" in a "uniquely Mancunian" way, where technology can help solve our social problems. Andy Burnham is quoted personally, saying "I don't want Greater Manchester to be just a smart city - I want it to be the _smartest_ city". The detail futher on in the document reinforce these messages.
