### A fantasy of a harmonious digital revolution

In December 2018, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority released their Greater Manchester Digital Strategy. In it, Manchester is transformed... it is no longer a place with any downsides. Inequality, pollution, homelessness, and democracy have all been solved thanks to global verture capitalists seeing to make fortunes. These rich global investors will help to create interesting creative jobs for everyone in an innovative utopia of wonderful creativity, a place of global sigificance but unique local character, and a place that does not tolerate social deprivation. It will be Silicon Valley in the North of England, but without any of the downsides that exist in California, and a place that _all_ people in Greater Manchester people will benefit from.

This is not only a complete fantasy, but there is nothing unique in having such grandiose and fantastical economic delusions. The wonderful smart city of the future is a dream many other cities are chasing. Very few of these visions recognise the dark side of Silicon Valley that is inseparable from the beautiful and innovative facade. And instead of being based on local character, the global smart city enables capitalism make every city the same. Instead, Manchester has a much radical tradtions that we can use to make a better digital economy that works better for the vast majority (but possibly not for the rich).

### heading



This digital stand of the Greater Manchester Strategy kicked off in 2017 with Andy Burnham setting up a digital summit, [a promise he made in his mayoral election manifesto](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/andy4mayor/pages/68/attachments/original/1489493923/Andy_Burham_Manifesto_A4_12pp_copy.pdf?1489493923). [One remarks on a "pretty stellar" line-up](https://cityverve.org.uk/setting-the-agenda-for-a-digital-manchester/) with some real rock stars of digital business in attendance. In planning to help Manchester reach the target of being the [best digital city](link), Andy Burnham invited over [over 200 experts from the digital and tech community](https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/news/crowdsourced-digital-action-plan-to-take-greater-manchester-to-the-top/) as well as other "key influencers" (Digital Strategy page X). Andy Burham wants this investment in tech to "do good", solve social, environmental and economic problems in today's world. However, for a plan that aims to solve social and environmental challenges, isn't it somewhat strange not invite anyone who might have expertise in those areas? This may be a little unfair from the perspective of 2019 when tech entrepeneurs are failing dismally at reshaping the world for good. But couldn't Andy invite someone who actually knows about social and environmental issues? This has been one of the major failings of Silicon Valley... over-confident geeks believing they can solve all our social issues with a new app, without actually knowing anything about these issues, and embracing Ayn Rand's philosophy of "who will stop me?" Companies like Facebook, Twiiter, Google, Reddit and YouTube all claimed to want to improve the world with tech. Where has that got us? Isn't it time the rest of the world got a say in how technology is reconfiguring the world?

This absence of critical voices is reflected in the Greater Manchester Digital Strategy, with the tone utterly utopian. Except for one reference to the uncertainty of automation and AI, the document recognises no downsides to any aspect of the digital economy. There is no serious investigation about whether tech will improve society. Instead, the strategy merely functions as a glossy brochure that presents tells us that more economic growth, more tech, and entrepreneurial zeal will create a future where everyone is happy, living in harmony alongside nature, without pollution and without any social problems. The smart city means all our social, environmental, and economic problems are fixed without any politicians having to make difficult decisions, and without any business having to be taxed or regulated. The new digital lexicon of trendy Californian start-ups helps cover over the absence of any solid empirical evidence and critical thought: simply calling things "open", "connective", "networked", "bottom-up", and "democratic" creates a fantasy of a better world. By using this language, it avoids having to investigate whether this is _truly_ improving society. 


The key targets seem to indicate the overall picture. The measures include increased economic growth, as well as an increase in the average wage from £41k to £44k for digital-related jobs. It aims to measure a decrease businesses turning down work because of a lack of skills. Other measures include increasing digital literacy (making sure everyone can use online services), better digital infrastructure, and a focus on decreasing the gender gap in digital workplaces. While the last two points do attempt to address some of the social issues in tech, the point on increasing digital skills is arguably just trying to fix a barrier to profit for digital businesses. For example, this target could be as much about ensuring older people have enough computer knowledge to buy stuff online and order an Uber from their phone as much as it is ensuring older people are able to maintain social relationships in a digital society. It could arguably be about austerity - [ensuring everyone can use public services online would mean that "efficiency" is improved... i.e. the workforce can be reduced](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/public-sector-transformation-needs-head-links/). Inviting in social scientists and critical voices might be a bit awkward - for example, recent research showed that rather than lacking skills, [perhaps older people _don't want_ to use digital tools](https://phys.org/news/2018-03-older-people-digital-technologies.html), but this digital strategy doesn't really give people that choice, it says we "must" go digital. That leaves only one point on gender equality in tech that definitively is addressing a social problem. This is clearly a major issue (link) but then this is only one issue of many inside tech companies (link) and totally ignores the impact of tech on the rest of society. None of these targets focus on the massive social issues that have come about from Silicon Valley's startup economy. The vast centralisation of power and data that occurs when Google, Facebook, Amazon and so on hoover up most of the successful startups. No mention of mass-surviellance, online hate, income inequality, tech company accountability, or any of the many social issues that frequently appear in the news in 2019. In the place of specific strategies and targets to ensure tech is used for the benefit of all are vague aspirations, visions, and anecdotes. The unstated assumption is that economic growth and new tech will solve all these problems, or else that simply stating that inequality will "not be tolerated" will mean these problems sort themselves out. In 2019, after tech companies have created crisis after crisis, surely most people in Greater Manchester would not want to trust tech companies to decide the future of the region.

### Frictionless Capitalism 

"quote" from strategy

The strategy says that they want GM to be "the best environment to nurture, welcome and grow digital businesses" by ensuring "that our digital ecosystem is as frictionless as possible." 

The word "friction" can say a lot, and also hide a lot. It sounds bad. If you have any kind of machinery, you want consider that friction is something that stops it operating smoothly. So friction must be bad! The problem is that friction in the "digital ecosystem" what is called "friction" are things like your permission, or regulations about lawful use of data, or workers rights, or trade unions demanding that workers have decent working conditions and pay. Removal of all possible frictions - regulations, unions, taxes, and so on, this has long been a liberarian utopia of the government getting out of the way, and letting the rationality of the market dictate what happens. The Internet has made such dreams seem a little bit more possible to libertarians. Unshackled from the limitations of the physcial world where were are constrained by geography, borders, and governments, the Internet can finally release us from this and bring about a glorious capitalist world. The GM Digital Strategy reveals this libertarian dream in it promise to removal all friction. Capitalism, [released from the chains of the physical world, can transcend to making profits flow at near-light speeds](link). Of course, the people of Greater Manchester hasn't been consulted about whether we want this liberatarian dream, the writers of the strategy have decided that "we must".


Data collection is an essential part of the digital economy. The phrase "data is the new oil" a tedious and mindless phrase often thrown around at these tech gatherings, as if data is an abstract resource that miraculously appears from nowhere, as if is not actually data about people and our lives. However, the phrase does tell us something, that a flow of data is essential to digital companies, and so continuous flows of data into the digital economy must be maintained at all costs, even if it requires intervention of the state do ensure this happens (Harvey, Companion to Marx's Capital, p. 638). The Silicon Valley mentality is to act first, ask permission later, a culture that makes it acceptable to avoid having to ask permission and regulation. By taking advantage of lax government regulations, this version of capitalism can create vast profits from regulatory loopholes, and then, once digital businesses are dependent on these loopholes, the government will be terrified to regulate it and potentially hurt economic growth. It is a similar story with individuals permission. For a long time, tracking on the internet has been turned on by default, without you being asked for your permission. GDPR was a step in the right direction, but the fact that implementing such an obvious law became such a difficult fight shows how tricky it is to regulate these companies once they are dependent on lax laws for their profits.

As a necessary part of their function, Greater Manchester startups will need be collecting data about Greater Manchester's residents in order to provide to services. In order to make GM attractive to overseas venture capitalists, who would have to choose GM over many other smart cities that are competiting with us, GM will have to try to ensure that these venture capitalists can make more profit here than in other places. Venture capitalists are only worried about one thing, and that is having as much profit as possible. In order to realise the most profit, GM will need to remove areas of "friction" that slow down the realisation of profit. As we have seen, the "friction" we are talking about is actually things like your permission and regulations. If this flow of data is not fast enough, your permission will surely be considered to be one of causes of "friction" which is preventing these startups from succeeding. If Andy Burnahm is serious about GM being the "smartest city", you can be certain that GM will, when possible, helpfully overlook encourage startups to bypass permissions and regulations. [GCHQ has launched a start-up "accelarator" in Manchester](https://mspl.co.uk/news/gchq-launches-first-manchester-tech-start-up-accelerator/), and a time when security and the Manchester bombing can be used as a reason to surveil everyone in Manchester by default, the trend is starting already.

https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/trafford-centre-bosses-explain-used-15283677

We should be thankful that there are a number of critics of state surveillance involved in Manchester's digital economy, such as Technical Fault and Loz Kaye. These activists will help to prevent some of the awful scenes. However, unsolicited monitoring and use of data startups is a risk if the tech sector is not wise to this. If Andy Burnham wants to make it very easy for surveilance to take place in Manchester he will find these activists difficult to surmount. But we need to be wise to other ways that our data can be grabbed without permission. Additionally, the handing over of data from public sector organisations in Manchester needs to be ensured too. 
We can see an example of avoiding accountability in Google's partnership with the NHS. This partnership was supposed to be used by Google to develop new products for health, while NHS data was supposed to be walled off so that Google couldn't use your personal health data to add to their personal profiles of you. Even to start with - why should the NHS be helping Google make money? But then, it turns out, Google have decided to backtrack on some of the promises they made and suddenly all your private and confidential information could potentially be on its way to Google HQ without you being asked. As Manchester's public institutions create "partnerships" with private businesses, this stealthy theft of our data from public institions may become common as desperate and underfunded services sell your data - one of their valuable assets - over to a private company without you being asked. The GM Strategy says is necessary to provide "efficiencies", potentially causing a number of losses as public services get digitised and human beings become more and more redundant. 

Citing the Manchester bombings. 

A few examples of this are already emerging in GM now. We have heard recently of [millions of people have their footfall tracked already in Manchester City Centre without their knowledge](https://twitter.com/MikAlexH/status/1071392667442036736), while [councillors are silent on adverts using facial recognition in billboards](https://twitter.com/LozKaye/status/966967172420468737) without your permission. 



 
As Manchester digital activist Loz Kaye says, politicians have a great optimism about the digital strategy. But optimism is not necessarily good: this optimism is a fantasy, the reality is more likely to be a privatised digital dystopia.

### social disaster will be solved with an app

Lots of talk has been in the news recently about AI and automation. Some economists and thinktanks are optimistic, saying that better jobs will be created for everyone, while others like those a the World Economic forum and XX are concerned. Alternative economic thinktanks such as nef, automation, and studies by labour unions are far more pesimistic. What is interesting the pessiissm of Silicon Valley thinkers. Elon Musk, and others have started a organisation to warn people about the dangers of AI, while others like Garcia Martinez have decided that automation will bring about a disaster so big that he is holed out in a forest and armed with guns. But Silicon Valley techies are not doing anything significant to stop this happening. Automation and AI will create vast efficiencies, but with the centralisation of power and wealthy especially in the tech sector, where a few companies monopolise the market, any benefits from this automation will go to a few rich investors and owners, while large parts of the rest of the population will lose our jobs. The Greater Manchester Digital Strategy doesn't deny there could be massive disruption (of the bad kind), saying that new tech could be "hugely disruptive both for the UK but also for the GM economy, having a profound and potentially unprecedented impact on production techniques, supply chains, business models, workforce and global networks." The focus here is on disruption to businesses. The social problems caused by this are left unstated, which stands to reason, since no social scientists or trade unions were invited to contribute.

A [study by PriceWaterhouseCoopers](https://www.pwc.co.uk/services/economics-policy/insights/the-impact-of-automation-on-jobs.html) suggests 30% of jobs could be lost to automation, particularly [low-waged jobs](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/08/the-potential-to-automate-low-wage-jobs-in-the-u-s-and-its-impact-on-workers) and jobs [women bearing the brunt](https://www.thersa.org/about-us/media/2018/women-bearing-the-brunt-of-job-losses-as-age-of-automation-takes-hold-warns-rsa). 

One of the surprises  about reading Capital Vol I was how this is so similar to the Victorian era. Reading about the situation with automation of the weavers jobs in the first industrial revolution is impossible to ignore simiarities to the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution. Weavers collectively resisted automation, destroying machines that threatened their jobs; before turning their attacks on the capitalists who were laying them off rather than the machines. They did not succeed, after after being made redundant, were hired back but on vastly lower wages. By creating mass unemployment, capitalism keeps wages low because we are so desperate to work. These people became known as the Luddites, now an unfair byword for those who hate technology. This is wrong: they hated the way capitalism used technology to destroy them, not the machines themselves (link to capital vol 1). Automation and AI is the 21st Century's nightmare for the working class, and even mega-capitalists such as Elon Musk are considering radical ideas such as UBI. (REFERNCE Automation thinktank).

It shows us a future where all our problems can be solved with an app. There is little analysis of whether apps have solved these social issues in existing smart cities. This is probably because there _are no cities that have solved these social issues with an app_. Even though plenty are trying. For example, Seattle did a great job with their app to solve homelessness, which [served to push out homeless people](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/an-app-for-ejecting-the-homeless/563849/). If that doesn't work, perhaps a Manchester startup can make some [contact lenses that make homeless people disappear](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/silicon-valleys-solutionism-issues-appear-to-be-scaling). Since Manchester council wanted to implement a Public Space Protection Order to get kick homeless out of the city centre, this might an app they would be totally on board with (REF). If we want to help young people find work and training, perhaps could get Facebook to help young people find job opportunities [by spying on their online activies and illegally harvesting their data](http://www.cityam.com/272471/facebook-removes-controversial-app-pays-teenagers-their). As Evgeny Morozov covers in _Click Here to Fix Everything_, an app can solve anything. What social issue have you got? Poor recycling rates? Well - lets make an app that automatically takes pictures of your bins to motivate everyone to recycle! Don't like the greater Manchester politicians - [lets just use algorithms and data and we don't have to have any](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/20/rise-of-data-death-of-politics-evgeny-morozov-algorithmic-regulation). 


In _Chaos Monkeys_ by Antionio Garcia Marquez, we are given a personal insight into the world of startups, big tech and venture capitalism. After several years setting up a startup, getting acquired and working for Facebook, concludes that win was get enough "fuck-you money" to live on a yacht the rest of your life by getting acquired, through immoral practices that "nobody was regulating" but other industries, these everyday practices of manipulating prices would result in people "hauled off to jail". Dreams of changing the world for good are sacrificed for to demands of venture capitalists that demand startups become billion dollar companies or die trying. This shows how "capitalism is an amoral farce" where breaking the law is normal because "success forgives all sins". Interestingly, he uses the same language as Marx, who describes how joint-stock companies means company leaders simply become managers of "other people's money". The Silicon Valley startup founder exploits themselves and their employees through crazy working hours and awful conditions. Venture capitalists get rich from other people's labour, while the founders hope they win the lottery and can escape their role as workers and join the yacht-owning non-working capitalist class. The dream of getting acquired, if successful, means the founders get rich, and the acquiring company (Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook or some other monopoly) gets to own all the good ideas and patents, all of the data, and any innovative technologies.

It is a common part of liberal beliefs that we can all be winners, all equal and successful. At school, children are told about how winning is less important than taking part. It is rarely acknowledged in capitalism that economic losers can exist: we are told that capitalism works for everyone. However, this is somewhat at odds with capitalism since it the basis of capitalism is competition, the driving force (allegedly) of efficiency and innovation. But competition with only winners makes no sense; a competition has losers too. The GM Digital Strategy makes a notable mention of these losers, before moving on.

The Silicon Valley economy is inseperable from its dark side. Increasingly, stories show Silicon Valley creates a faceless, unequal, and ??? society. [Inequality is getting worse](https://www.recode.net/2018/10/13/17953004/wages-workers-silicon-valley-income-inequality) with the rich getting incredibly wealthy, while the poor are worse off. Residents struggle to afford basics such as [housing](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2019/02/15/report-inequality-on-the-rise-in-silicon-valley) in a market where Airbnb and other apps have completely changed the economy, while childcare and transportation are increasingly unaffordable. While most cannot afford transport, workers in tech companies have their own private buses, and anger at their impact on the economy is demonstrated by ([Google's private bus service being attacked](https://mashable.com/2018/01/17/google-bus-attacked/?europe=true). Meanwhile, persoal accounts of the startup industry do not show a world of innovation. [Wendy Liu](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/digitaliberties/silicon-inquiry/) describes her startup as a "desperate yearning for our startup to mean something", and worked herself into the ground for an illusion. In reality the only startups that get funding are those who make massive returns for private investors. [Antonio Garcia Marquez in Chaos Monkeys](REF) tells a similar story, and after several years in a startup and Facebook concludes that Silicon Valley is an "amoral farce" running on incompetence, greed and vanity, hidden behind a fantasy of meritocracy, a place where massive profits forgives all your sins. In (Move Fast and Break Things)[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/napster-spotify-and-the-fall-of-the-middle-class-musician-116858/], Jonathan Taplin describes how "innovative" sites like Napster and YouTube made many musicians almost peniless. Other horrific stories about Silicon Valley experiences are increasingly widespread. 

The Greater Manchester Digital Strategy wants to have the Silicon Valley model of capitalism. They only talk about the shiny facade that presents itself to the world - but this is inseperable from the inequality, exploitation and monopolisation of power that has occurred in California.


### Doing things differently, just like everywhere else

"I want Greater Manchester to be a digital city with a difference", [Andy Burnham](https://www.thinkdigitalpartners.com/news/2017/05/23/burnham-sets-ambitious-plan-future-smart-city-manchester/). 

The strategy has a major emphasis on being different, innovative, open, connected, thinking outside the box. It tells us that we can be a world leader but also Mancunian. It tells us that we can have a digital economy with well-known digital companies based here alongside small startups, innovation labs, and local businesses, working together. What makes Greater Manchester different, it says, is an aspiration be "bottom up", to make progress "universal", where problems like inequality and homelessness are not tolerated - these social issues will be resolve by businesses who develop apps, cruch data, and develop new products to solve everything.

It is also evident from the claim to be "unique" and "different" that the writers and attendees at these summits are completely unfamiliar with every other government digital strategy across the world. If they had done such research, they would be surely be surprised to discover these words and claims of being "different" and "unique" are used by almost every other city region's digital strategy. A quick Google on the subject turns up a plethora of other similar smart city plans... [Sadiq Kahn wants London to be the smartest city](https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-launches-smart-london-plan), [New York claims to be the smartest city](https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/909-16/new-york-named-2016-best-smart-city-nyc-host-2017-international-conference-urban), [so does San Jose]( http://www.sanjoseca.gov/index.aspx?NID=5730), and [Melbourne](https://connection.vic.gov.au/?result_17022_result_page=11). [Melbourne wants to be a smart city with "social impact"](https://dif.vic.gov.au/editorial/642-a/using-technology-for-real-social-impact), [Austin claims to be a smart city that is both "bottom up" and "top down"](https://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=287471) which will improves the lives of "all Austinites", while all Londoners will benefit from their strategy (https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/social_integration_strategy.pdf). [Birmingham](http://digitalbirmingham.co.uk/service/smart-cities/), [Swansea](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-news/13-billion-city-swansea-bay-12764509), [Newcastle and Gateshead](https://www.newcastlegateshead.com/conferences/latest-news/2018/1/30/newcastle-to-spearhead-smart-cities-revolution-with-ps40m-construction-technology-centre-of-excellence-a2602), [Leicester](https://greenbridge.our.dmu.ac.uk/sustainable-smart-cities-what-could-this-mean-for-leicester/)... hmm, there appears to be a pattern here! But it's not just cities, but [manufacturing](https://www.i-scoop.eu/manufacturing-industry/), [libraries](https://www.leicestershire.gov.uk/leisure-and-community/libraries/smart-libraries), [universities](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/22/are-university-campuses-turning-into-mini-smart-cities), [transport](https://www.zdnet.com/article/smart-cities-why-oslo-wants-its-buses-to-do-far-more-than-just-transport-people/), [hospitals](https://readwrite.com/2019/03/01/smart-hospitals-the-next-step-in-healthcare-it/), [farms](https://medium.com/zerone-magazine/smart-agriculture-for-smart-city-726f53f78b47). Everyone wants everything to be "smart" - in fact what would be truly original these days would be to question the smart city, and question the neoliberal idea that private companies and entrepeneurs can solve all our problems. What would be original and different would be to question the idea that we "must" adopt this smart city and compete for the attention of global venture capitalists. It would be truly different to think of a better way of running the economy.

But Andy Burnham didn't invite anyone who would be critical of the Smart City utopia. That would have burst his little fantasy. Academics, campaigners, trade unions and other experts appear to be not invited to feed into this party. Other recent and future events on the digital strategy have focused only on bringing digital experts together, again, excluding anyone social scientists, trade unions, or technology critics. [Loz Kaye remarks on the positivity in the room at these meetings](https://openintelligence.uk/news/technology/greater-manchester-digital-tech-summit/). Well, that's easily achieved by not inviting any critics.

 It is clear then that Manchester's claims to be unique appears to be not grounded in any substance... in 2019 everywhere and everything wants to be smart. The GM Digital strategy says that "we _can_" and "we _must_" (their italics), just like every other city. All these cities are competing to be the winner, to attract the global investors. To win is to be the best, as Burnham puts it, "the _smartest_ city". This is, of course, the smart city version of the famous quote from Thatcher, "there is no alternative". In a way, within the internal logic of neoliberal capitalism, it is true, there is no alternative. You _must_ be more competitive, productive, and efficient. Businesses, countries, and cities have no choice but to do these things, otherwise we will be the economic losers. In the GM Digital Strategy, "winning" is about being the "smartest city" and attracting the most outside investment, and it is clear that many other cities want to be the world leaders too. So in the logic of competition, all these city regions must compete to attract this global investment. Existing businesses "cannot afford to overlook such fundamental shifts in the market". Accept the new digital world, businesses are told, or that will be the end of your business. You "cannot afford" not to. There is no arguing with this, no fighting it, you embrace or die, there is no other way, so the logic goes. What happens if we don't win in this inter-city competition? This is not dicussed... but to keep things simple, lets assume that Manchester does "win", and find out what this looks like.

### manchester's history shows a real alternative 

marx talking about cooperatives - 
Andy Burnham cites Manchester's history of creating innovative solutions to old problems. But what this investigation has shown is that he is using solutions that have already been tried and have failed. The global competition to attract investment means creating the most business-friendly city (i.e. deregulation, privitisation, and diverting tax-payers money into corporations); social chaos caused by startups trying to fix our social and economic problems; inequality driven by the concentration of wealth; and the potentially terrible consequences of automation and AI on jobs. This model is not new. In fact, this model is one of the reasons there are crises over companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, that dominate our digital lives, and it needs to end. 
 
Instead we need to look at Greater Manchester's geniune radical history for inspiration. Trade unions, socialism, Chartists* and cooperative movements are some of these ideas. and  In 1844 the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers formed, in response to the Industrial Revolution, which was forcing more and more people into poverty to mechinisation of their trades. Nowadays, Manchester is home to the UK largest cooperative - the Cooperative Group. It is somewhat unrecognisable from the traditional cooperatives, with a convoluted and confusing democratic system, unaccountable senior members on massive salaries, resulting little worker control over their activies. [Mondragon is perhaps a better example](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/24/alternative-capitalism-mondragon): where workers get to choose which directors to hire and fire, where there is a cap on wage differences, and enables workers to decide what and how they produce. 

In the digital sector, cooperative alternatives do exist too. In Catalonia, the Cooperativa Integral Catalana (CIC) is testing the possiblities of worker owned technologies. Its stated purpose is to create an alternative economy that satisfies the needs of the people in the region. https://p2pfoundation.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/The-Catalan-Integral-Cooperative.pdf. Cooperatives form a key part of the municipal governments economic strategy. Data is not just used as a means to make profit, it is ["treated like it is someone's stuff"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038026118758533). Research is published under licences that mean everyone can access information and technologies, encouraging a geniune peer-to-peer economy. Rather than profits being taken outside of the region, to a few rich billionaires, profits are aimed to be redistributed around the city. 

Andy Burnham says* that we have no choice but to embrace this model, but of course this is an illusion. We only have no choice if we accept neoliberalism as the only means of managing the economy. But Manchester's history shows an alternative exists; Barcelona is showing how this can work in the digital economy; and of course, he is in a Labour Party, which published a manifesto on alternative forms of ownership, which embraced cooperative ideas and redistributive economics. Allegedly, Andy Burham is a member of the Labour Party - as well as the Co-operative Party, which is linked to Labour - so it is somewhat of a mystery that he is not aware of an alternative! Perhaps he hasn't been paying attention. Of course, getting the all the regions of Greater Manchester to support a cooperative economy would be challenging. Andy Burnham suggests that he want ["Manchester to be the most cooperative place in the UK"](https://party.coop/2018/07/30/andy-burnham-announces-co-operative-commission-to-ensure-manchester-the-most-co-operative-region-of-uk/), but this is totally at odds with the GM digital strategy of attracting massive outside investment from venture capitalists. His statements about having a "small number of evidence sessions" and asking for evidence from experts are signs of someone who wants to hear the case from cooperatives, not someone who really believes in them, or thinks they can become a major part of the local economy. Once workers and society owns and controls the digital economy, we can actually direct investment into building tools that benefit society. However, Andy Burnham's recent attacks on workers organisations suggest that his opinions on workers control may be entirely geniune.

 It is fortunate that others in the party are pushing these ideas. Dan Carden in his manifesto for Sheffield, explicitly [supported cooperative organisations in a local manifesto](https://party.coop/2018/04/20/dan-jarvis-publishes-plans-for-a-co-operative-community-in-south-yorkshire/) to create local economy that is more democratic and equal.


### Discarded

The foreward by the GM mayor and Trafford Council leader Sean Anstree promises a fantastical future for the region. This will make Manchester "one of the best places in the world", where "all voices are heard", a place in which "together, we shape our future". This will create a "world-leading" economy that "draws in investment" from all corners of the world, but also is an economy that built "together" in a "universal" way, where everyone beneifts from a "bottom up" approach. It will be "game-changing", delivering "real change" in a "uniquely Mancunian" way, where technology can help solve our social problems. Andy Burnham is quoted personally, saying "I don't want Greater Manchester to be just a smart city - I want it to be the _smartest_ city". The detail futher on in the document reinforce these messages. 


 This frictionless future is a fantasy of a neoliberal zero-gravity utopia where capitalism pushes itself towards light speeds (Featherstone, 2010, IGC9)... which aims to resolve resolve all the failings of the present through more and more technology (Will Self, IGC9). However, these contradictions do not get resolved with more technology; these contradictions _are_ capitalism. The global competition for investment, to be "the smartest city" in practice, becomes are route to becoming the "most privatised city". Public resources such as land, data, money, expertise, and so on are directed into attracting these global businesses. They function as a bribe, but the utopian vision of the smart city believes these will create jobs, equality and security... which will happen at some point in the future... a beautiful future that will never happen. (Grossi, Pianezzi, Smart city utopia paper).


 
  

  (the existence of 'losers' as well as economic 'winners' is the terrible aspect of capitalism that we do not acknowledge, but which we still fear). (Enjoying Neoliberalism)
 
  In Todd McGowan's book, the Psychic Cost of Free Markets, he devotes one chapter to the role of sacrifice in capitalism. Capitalism considers itself beyond religion and God. And yet, everyday, while we work, we sacrifice ourselves for productivity and efficiency.  Our bodies may be damaged, our mental health may erode, we lose free time we could be spending on our hobbies and with our loved ones... the sacrifice in capitalism is the working class, whose lives must be given up willingly. We are promised if we word hard and sacrifice ourselves eventually we are promised to get our reward. We also may sacfice other things: nature, public services, ... etc. 


 
What does this mean for Manchester? Do we have sacrifice everything to make our city as business friendly as possible in order to get to this digital utopia that is within reach?



It is not just open data that these companies are after - your private and personal data will do if they can get it. In 2015(?) (a Google-owned company gained access to the UK's NHS data)[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/24/smartphone-apps-google-deepmind-nhs-hospitals] to develop new health products. There were many questions about (consent)[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/22/google_deepmind_signs_5year_agreement_with_nhs_for_streams_app/] because patients never agreed to this, but the company fended off criticism by saying this data (would not be shared with Google HQ)[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/nhs-deepmind-google-data-sharing]. But in 2018 (Google changed its mind)[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-deepmind-nhs-health-data] and now it is possible that all of our NHS extremely personal data could be shared with Google and used to track us and our behaviour across the Internet. Rules and regulations function for these insatiable data companies as just part of a game of global domination (a word Mark Zuckerberg loved to use in the early days of Facebook). So, to make Manchester attractive to digital companies, we presumably need to make it asy for them to access our data and to trade it: asking your permission would simply slow down their profits.


Manchester also provides [impressive open data services in Manchester](http://open.manchester.gov.uk/homepage/3/open_data_catalogue), which allow granular access of data on everything from car parks, to metrolinks, to street lighting. Of course, there is a positive element to this: open data can be used by local people to hold the authorities to account and build personal DIY projects. But open data is not happening in Manchester because there is a massive push from the public for it. It is happening because of business demand for our data, and to attract global business. Browing a  list of the open data services around the world, it is clear most of the open data is provided by public institutions, very few by private. When Google are asked why they won't open their services and algorithms, they state that doing so would give advantage to competitors. Why should public institutions open their data sources up if private businesses won't? In our 21st century capitalist economy, everything the public sector does is seen as inefficnent, if a private sector company can use this, they can innovate (obviously its impossible for the public sector to innovate). So it is seen as common sense that eht public sector should open their data and allow private business to profit from it, while the private sector get to keep all of theirs.
